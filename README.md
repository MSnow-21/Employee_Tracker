Project Description: The Employee Tracker is an application that allows a user to add departments, roles, and employees to their employee tracking database. The application also allows the user to view the departments, roles, and employees that have been added to this database. Another program feature updates the role (ex. accounting) with new information based on what the user specifies. The features of this program are accomplished through use of MySQL and Inquirer command prompts through programmed function calls. When the user wants to add a department for example, the program calls a function that intiates the prompts in the console. The prompts are modeled for columns that were created with the MySQL database. As the user answers the prompts, the answers are inserted into the database. When the user wants to view the database information, the user can follow the command prompt to the view prompt, which then calls a function to select the information from the database and display this information in the console.
